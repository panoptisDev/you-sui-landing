There were tens of thousands of people in the communities of various projects, and most users of the projects were not able to participate in Private Sale or IDO. Even related influencers could not easily participate in other Launchpad platforms, and demanded new Launchpad platforms suitable for the Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese markets. So, we are going to provide users with experiences and opportunities such as INO, IDO, and IGO for the convenience of users, focusing on projects that we are incubating or developed in the future.'

You have probably read about some of the most popular types of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly popular alternatives for online payments. Before converting real dollars, euros, pounds, or other traditional currencies into â‚¿ (the symbol for Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency), you should understand what cryptocurrencies are, what the risks are in using cryptocurrencies, and how to protect your investment.',
          'What is cryptocurrency? A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. These wallets can be software that is a cloud-based service or is stored on your computer or on your mobile device. The wallets are the tool through which you store your encryption keys that confirm your identity and link to your cryptocurrency.',

Furthermore, as a reaction to the trending market, many protocol chains dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars of investment to NFTs and video games.',
